The original dataset is as described below.  In addition to those variables, the following tables and variables were added:

1. activity_labels

Imported from original data "activity_labels.txt", this information was joined onto the train and test datasets.  
This replaces activity codes (1-6) with descriptive labels: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

2. features

Imported from original data "features.txt" these 561 fields were not modified.

3. map_Y_train

This table contains the mapping of activity_labels with the activity code, as described in bullet 1.

The same step was conducted for map_Y_test, which is structured identically to train.

4. full_train_dataset

This table combines: subject_number, activity_code, activity_labels, and the 561 data elements described in bullet 2.

The same step was conducted for full_test_dataset, which is structured identically to train.

5. full_dataset

This table combines "full_train_dataset" and "full_test_dataset"

6. drop_non_numeric

This table identifies the subject_number, activity_code, and activity_description columns.

7. full_dataset_variables

This table removes the three columns identified in bullet 6.  We are now left with only the data columns, to which we can calculate mean and sd.

8. measurement_mean

This table calculates the mean for every column in bullet 7.

9. measurement_sd

This table calculates the sd for every column in bullet 7.

10. measurement_mean_and_sd

This table combines the tables in bullets 8. and 9. 

In the subsequent step, the variable names are added to the table.
The resulting table contains the mean and standard deviation for each variable in the dataset, appropriately labeled.


11. Table_X

The creation of this table is the first step in a process of summarizing the mean of each variable for each subject and each activity level.
The desired end result is a table with 180 rows (30 subjects, each of whom performed the 6 activities enumerated in bullet 1).

Table_X uses the "aggregate" function to generate a summary table for each of the 180 rows, but only for the first variable in the dataset.
As it stands, the table is in the right format but only has one column of means, when the final result needs 561 columns.


12. df

The dataframe "df" extracts just the first two columns of Table_X, namely the subject_number and activity_description without any data.

13. df, looped

The loop function steps through all 561 columns and generates a table using the "aggregate" function.  It then appends the column onto dataframe
"df".  For example, after 3 iterations, "df" will have 3 columns of means.  The 4th iteration will add a column with the mean of variable 4.
The 5th iteration will add the mean of variable 5, and so on.  When the loop is complete, the table is ready, but not labeled properly.

14. df_first_part

This extracts just the first two columns (subject_number and activity_description) in preparation for labeling.
The "colnames(df_first_part)" names the two columns with a simple statement.

15. df_second_part

This removes the first two columns, leaving the 561 data columns to prepare for labeling.
The "for" loop steps through the 561 columns, labeling each one.

16. tidy_data_set

This final step re-connects df_first_part and df_second_part which have now been labeled.

17. tidy_data_set.txt

This "write.table" command writes a text file of the desired summary table and concludes the code.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
